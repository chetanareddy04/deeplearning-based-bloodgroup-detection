## 🔎 Overview
This project focuses on applying deep learning techniques to automate blood group detection using image-based data. Two independent approaches are explored: one using blood sample images and another using fingerprint images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are trained to learn visual patterns from these images and classify them into corresponding blood groups. The trained models are integrated into a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload images and receive predictions in real time.

## 📖 Problem Statement
Accurate blood group identification is critical in medical emergencies, blood transfusions, and healthcare systems. Traditional blood typing methods require laboratory equipment, trained personnel, and time. This project explores an alternative approach using deep learning and image-based analysis to automate blood group detection from blood images and fingerprint images.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The project follows a deep learning–based image classification pipeline to predict blood groups using both blood sample images and fingerprint images.

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Blood group image dataset collected from Kaggle
- Fingerprint image dataset used for non-invasive prediction
- Images organized into folders based on blood group classes

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing
- Image resizing to **224 × 224**
- Pixel value normalization
- Conversion of images into arrays
- Dataset splitting into training and testing sets

### Step 3: Model Development
- Transfer learning using **MobileNetV2**
- CNN-based classification model
- Final dense layer added for **8 blood group classes**
  - A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-

### Step 4: Model Training
- Models trained separately for:
  - Blood image dataset
  - Fingerprint image dataset
- Optimization using Adam optimizer
- Loss function: categorical crossentropy

### Step 5: Model Evaluation
- Performance measured using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Performance analysis charts

### Step 6: Deployment
- Models saved as **.h5 files**
- Flask web application created for prediction
- Users can upload an image and get real-time prediction results
